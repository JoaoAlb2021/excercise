1. How do you see the files changed within each commit from git log?
I can see the last commit, reading the code commit
2. How do you see the contents of what changed within each file from the git log?
We can use the comand cat file_name to see the content
3. What does HEAD refer to in the context of git? (Not to be confused with the "HEAD>>>>>" one observes within merge conflict)
